# Programming3

## What is it?
This is my final project which I've made during the "Programming 3" workshop held at TUMO Center for Creative Technologies in Yerevan. 

### About "Programming 3"
In the rest of the workshop we've learned the basics of the use of Node.js platform and some of its useful modules/libraries 
(e.g. express, socket.io) in order to create, configure and manage a basic server-side application.

#### The final project for "Programming 3"  
As a final project we had to develop our previous projects which we had made during the "Programming 2" workshop again held at TUMO.

##### The final project for "Programming 2"
As a final project for "Programming 2" we had to make our version of the game named "Game of Life" with the use of p5 library(for graphics).
The whole project involved only frontend programming with Javascript.

###### More information about "Programming 2"
You can check for more information about "Programming 2" workshop and my final project which I've made during it at my "Programming2"
repository which will be published soon.

#### What was done ?
Now we've added some new features to our previous projects which are representing our skills of server-side programming with Node.js.
